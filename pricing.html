        <h1>Pricing</h1>
        
        <p>Vespa charges by the machine resources allocated to your applications in three dimensions:</p>
        
        <table class="price">
        <tr><td><b>Per vcpu hour:</b></td>      <td>$0.12</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>Per memory Gb hour:</b></td> <td>$0.012</td></tr>
        <tr><td><b>Per disk Gb hour:</b></td>   <td>$0.0004</td></tr>
        </table>
        
        <p>In production zones, the resources you allocate are precisely what you specify in services.xml for the duration
        the application is deployed.</p>
        
        <p>In dev, and test zones, applications will by default be
        <a href="/reference/environments">downscaled</a> and you will be charged for
        the capacity actually used. In test zones, applications will only allocate resources while tests are running.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to machine resource costs, network costs incurred by your application are passed on to you at
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/#Data_Transfer">standard AWS prices</a>.
        These depend only on how you use your applications.</p>
