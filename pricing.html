<p>
Our pricing is simple and transparent.
All customers receive all our features and services, and we charge a fee proportional to
the size of the application, summed over three dimensions:
</p>
<table class="price">
<tr>
<td>Per vcpu hour:</td>
<td><b>$0.09</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Per memory Gb hour:</td>
<td><b>$0.009</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Per disk Gb hour:</td>
<td><b>$0.0003</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Included is everything you need to run a production service with confidence:

<h3>The fine print</h3>
<p>
Resources allocated in production zones are precisely what specified in <a href="reference/services">services.xml</a>
for the duration the application is deployed. If resources are specified in ranges (autoscaling)
the resources allocated at any time is the optimal allocation inside the range.
In dev and test zones, applications will by default be <a href="/reference/environments">downscaled</a>,
and charges are by the actual usage summed over time.
</p>
<p>
In addition, we reserve the right to pass on network ingress/egress costs incurred by application usage at
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/#Data_Transfer">standard AWS prices</a>.
