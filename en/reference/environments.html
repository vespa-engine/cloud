<p>
An application can be deployed to a <em>zone</em>,
which is a combination of an <em>environment</em> and a <em>region</em>.
This explains the rules governing the various environments.
A <a href="zones">list of all zones</a> is also available.

<h2 id="production">Production</h2>

<p>
Deployments in <code>prod</code> must have at least one more node than required to handle peak load.
A cluster is a <em>container</em> or <em>content</em> cluster,
and a regular application has a container <em>and</em> a content cluster.
A minimal, typical <code>prod</code> deployment therefore has 4 nodes.
</p>


<h2 id="dev-and-perf">Dev and Perf</h2>

<p>
<code>dev</code> and <code>perf</code> are deployed to directly as part of development or testing.
</p>

<p>
In order to easily deploy application packages from prod applications,
resources are downscaled in dev and perf.
To control the resources you get in these zones, specify them explicitly for the environment in question (dev or perf)
as described in
<a href="services#instance-environment-and-region-variants">environment and region variants</a>,

<p>To deploy to the perf environment, use</p>
<pre>
mvn package vespa:deploy -Denvironment=perf
</pre>


<h3 id="vespa-version">Vespa version</h3>

<p>
In <code>dev</code> and <code>perf</code>, the latest active Vespa version is used when deploying.
An instance is not upgraded, unless deployed to.
This means that some times, a deploy takes longer than normal,
as it invokes a Vespa upgrade before deploying the application package.
