<p>
  This guide assumes you have deployed an application to the <code>dev</code>
  zone as detailed in <a href="getting-started">getting started</a>.
</p>

<p>Prerequisites: git, openssl, JDK 11 or higher, mvn 3.6 or higher.</p>


<h2 id="understand-prod-deployments">1. Understand prod deployments</h2>

<p>
  While applications in the <code>dev</code> zone are deployed manually by a developer,
  deployments to <code>prod</code> zones should happen automatically on source changes
  by creating a build job in your preferred continuous build tool that
  builds the application and submits it to Vespa for production roll-out.
</p>

<p>
  To make this safe the application needs tests that validate it.
  These tests are executed automatically on each deployment.
  See <a href="automated-deployments">automated deployments</a> for more details.
</p>


<h2 id="add-tests-to-your-application">2. Add tests to your application</h2>

<p>
  Here we are using the files that fit with
  <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/vespa-cloud/album-recommendation">album recommendation</a>
  the application used in <a href="getting-started">getting started</a>.
</p>

<ol class="howto">

<li>
  <p>
    If you don't have it, add a <code>pom.xml</code> file to the application root.
    This is the Maven project configuration, and is needed to build with the Vespa Cloud test framework.
    See this <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/vespa-cloud/album-recommendation-prod">this example</a>.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
    If you haven't, update the <code>tenant</code> and <code>application</code> properties in <code>pom.xml</code>
    to match the names of your tenant and application.
  </p>
<pre>
&lt;properties&gt;
    ...
    &lt;tenant&gt;MYTENANT&lt;/tenant&gt;
    &lt;application&gt;MYAPP&lt;/tenant&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;
</pre>


<li>
  <p>
    Add the tests that build the test framework.
    These tests reside in the <code>src/test/java</code> directory of the application.
    You can copy the sample tests in
    <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/tree/master/vespa-cloud/album-recommendation-prod/src/test/java/ai/vespa/example">album-recommendation-prod/src/test/java/ai/vespa/example</a>
    in sample-apps.
  </p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
  Refer to <a href="automated-deployments.html#developing-tests">developing tests</a> to create your own tests.
</p>


<h2 id="add-a-deployment-descriptor-to-your-application">3. Add a deployment descriptor to your application</h2>

<p>
  Create a <a href="reference/deployment">deployment.xml</a>
  file in <code>src/main/application</code> containing
</p>

<pre>
&lt;deployment version="1.0"&gt;
    &lt;prod&gt;
        &lt;region active="true"&gt;aws-us-east-1c&lt;/region&gt;
    &lt;/prod&gt;
&lt;/deployment&gt;
</pre>


<h2 id="build-and-submit-the-application-revision">4. Build and submit the application revision</h2>

<p>Now you are ready to build and submit the application revision:</p>

<ol class="howto">

<li>
  <p>Add the Vespa Cloud compile version to the application package:</p>
<pre>
$ mvn vespa:compileVersion -DapiKeyFile=$HOME/Downloads/TENANTNAME.pem
</pre>
</li>

<li>
  <p>Compile the application package with test artifacts:</p>
<pre>
$ mvn package -Dvespa.compile.version="$(cat target/vespa.compile.version)"
</pre>
</li>

<li>
  <p>Submit the application package to Vespa Cloud for deployment:</p>
<pre>
$ mvn vespa:submit -DapiKeyFile=$HOME/Downloads/TENANTNAME.pem
</pre>

  <p>
    The application revision is now being tested and (if successful) deployed to the production
    zones prescribed in your <a href="reference/deployment">deployment.xml</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can track deployment progress and view logs in the <a href="http://console.vespa.ai">console</a>.
  </p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
  It is always safe to submit a new revision of your application.
  You should now configure a continuous build job in your preferred build tool
  to perform these three commands whenever a change
  to your application source is checked in and merged.
</p>


<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>
  The Vespa Cloud application is now running in a production zone.  Congratulations!
  After this you can further enhance the production application:
</p>

<ol class="howto">

<li>
  <p>
    To have redundancy for business continuity, consider setting up multiple
    <a href="reference/zones">production zones</a>
    in <a href="reference/deployment">deployment.xml</a>,
    and use a <a href="reference/deployment#endpoints">global endpoint</a>
    for queries.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>To create more tests to protect your production deployments, see
    <a href="automated-deployments.html#developing-tests">developing tests</a>.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
    Don't forget to set up a continuous build to initiate automatic deployment
    of changes to your application by running the
    <a href="#build-and-submit-the-application-revision">three commands above</a>.
    See an example usiung GitHub actions
    <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy-vespa-documentation-search.yaml">here</a>.
