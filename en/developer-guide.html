<p>
Using Vespa Cloud for development is easy.
See <a href="getting-started">getting started</a> to make your first deployment.
</p>

<h2 id="instances">Instances</h2>

<p>
Each deployment of an application to the <code>dev</code> zone is a separate <i>instance</i>
of the application. Using multiple instances lets developers work with the same application
separately or collaboratively as they prefer.
</p>

<p>
Consider the deploy command:

<pre>
$ mvn clean package vespa:deploy -DapiKeyFile=/path-to/uname.tname.pem \
  -Denvironment=dev \
  -Dregion=aws-us-east-1c \
  -Dtenant=mytenant \
  -Dapplication=vespacloud-docsearch \
  -Dinstance=myuser
</pre>

<p>This is equivalent to the <code>vespa:deploy</code> used in the getting started page:

<ul class="howto">
<li><p><code>environment</code> and <code>region</code> defaults to the <code>dev</code> <a href="reference/zones">zone</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>tenant</code> and <code>application</code> is normally set in <code>pom.xml</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>instance</code> must be set and can be anything, e.g a user, experiment or team name.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2 id="auto-downsizing">Auto downsizing</h2>

<p>
Deployments to dev are downscaled to one small node by default so that prod
applications can be deployed without changing services.xml.
If you need more resources in the dev application, set nodes or resources
explicitly by adding those tags to services.xml with a
<code>deploy:environment="dev"</code>,
see <a href="reference/services#instance-environment-and-region-variants">variants in services.xml</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>

<p>
The <code>dev</code> zone is not for production serving, and has no uptime guarantees.
</p>

<p>
An automated Vespa software upgrade can be triggered by <code>vespa:deploy</code>
and that may lead to some downtime if you have only one node per cluster
(as with the default <a href="#auto-downsizing">auto downsizing</a>).
</p>

<p>
To override the version, use
</p>

<pre>
-Dvespa.runtime.version=&lt;current deployed version>
</pre>

<p>when deploying.</p>


<h2 id="performance-testing">Performance testing</h2>

<p>
In addition to <code>dev</code> there is also a <code>perf</code> zone for performance testing.
This does less downscaling of resources, such that tests that can be extrapolated to production
are possible. In other ways this zone works the same way as dev. To deploy to perf, use
</p>

<pre>
-Denvironment=perf
</pre>

<h2 id="tips-and-troubleshooting">Tips and troubleshooting</h2>

<ul>

<li>
  <p>
    As Vespa Cloud upgrades daily, a deploy will some times pull the latest Vespa Version.
    This takes minutes as opposed to the seconds it normally takes.
    Start the day by deploying to avoid the wait!
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
    A common mistake is <code>pom.xml</code> mismatch. <code>tenant</code> and <code>application</code>
    is normally pulled from the pom -
    <a href="reference/vespa-cloud-api">details</a>.
    Errors here cause a 401 when deploying.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
    Likewise for data plane -
    remember to copy the public sertificate to <code>src/main/application/security/clients.pem</code>
    before building and deploying.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
    Set all keys in the IDE:
  </p>
<pre>
-Dtest.categories=system
-DapiKeyFile=/path-to/uname.tname.pem
-DdataPlaneCertificateFile=/path-to/data-plane-public-cert.pem
-DdataPlaneKeyFile=/path-to/data-plane-private-key.pem
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
