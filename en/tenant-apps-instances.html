<p>
  When registering for Vespa Cloud, a <em>tenant</em> is created.
  Tenant is the billable unit, and most often an organization.
</p>
<p>
  A tenant has one more more <em>applications</em> with one or more <em>instances</em>:

<p>
  Instances are used for different use cases,
  and are deployed to a set of <a href="reference/zones">zones</a> - example:
</p>

<p>
  The <em>Application</em> has a "default" instance serving queries from two <em>production</em> zones.
  It has an "integration" instance with another dataset, used for other applications to interface a
  production-like, stable interface.
  Finally, a developer has deployed the "bob" instance to a <em>dev</em> zone to further develop plugin code.
</p>
<p>
  Deployments to production zones are specified in <a href="reference/deployment.html">deployment.xml</a>.
  Deployments to manual zones like <em>dev</em> and <em>perf</em>
  are normally done directly from a developer computer for rapid code and config development.

</p>
<p>
  The service configuration is specified in <a href="reference/services.html">services.xml</a>
  and is composed of individually sized <em>clusters</em>.
  A cluster is deployed to a set of <em>nodes</em> with <em>resources</em> specified.
