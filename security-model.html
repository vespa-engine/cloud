For use of keys in automation, refer to examples in

                This key is used to access the Vespa Cloud control APIs.
                The key is set on the <em>tenant</em> level -
                it is hence valid for all applications for the tenant.
                The key is associated with a user
                and can be uploaded or generated in the "Keys" view in the
                <a href="http://console.vespa.ai/">Console</a>.

                Use this key to deploy/submit applications with Maven

                Use this key in CI/CD pipelines

            <th style="white-space: nowrap">Vespa API Certificate</th>

            <td><p>
                The key is a private key and X.509 certificate generated for the client.
                Only clients using the private key and certificate
                will be granted access to the application's data plane.
                Example data plane APIs are
                <a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/query-api">query</a> and
                <a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/reference/document-v1-api-reference.html">feed</a>.
                </p><p>
                Generate the certificate and key
                and include the certificate in the application package -
                example: <a href="/getting-started.html">create a self-signed certificate</a>.

<h2 id="control-plane">Control plane</h2>
<p>
The following explains how access to management features in Vespa is controlled.
</p>


<h3 id="roles">Roles</h3>
<p>
Console access is available to authenticated users only.
This is bootstrapped by creating a <em>tenant</em>.
<!-- ToDo with an <em>owner</em> - there is no concept of an owner ...-->
Manage users and roles in the <em>users</em> view: https://console.vespa.ai/tenant/<span style="background: yellow">tenant_name</span>/users:
<table class="table">
<thead></thead>
<tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Developer</th><td>Can create applications,
          deploy to dev zones and submit to prod zones.</td>
    </tr><tr>
      <th>Admin</th><td>Manage users and tenant information.
        Tenant information includes usage information and billing.
      </td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
</table>



<h3 id="application-deployment">Application deployment</h3>
<p>
There are two kinds of application deployments:
<ul>
    <li><a href="reference/zones">manual deployments</a> to dev/perf zones and</li>
    <li><a href="automated-deployments">automated deployments</a> to production zones</li>
</ul>
Likewise, there are two kinds of keys that can be used for API authentication:
<ul>
    <li>User API keys, which identify a member of the <em>developer</em> role,
        and allows, e.g., manual deployments and system tests, and</li>
    <li>Application API keys,
        which identify a build service which submits application packages for automated deployment</li>
</ul>
User API keys are personal, and are managed in the <em>users</em> view.
Each developer may have a single key at any time,
and both administrators and developers may revoke the key of another developer,
if it has been compromised. <!-- ToDo: that sounds odd - and Admin can manage other users, right? -->
</p><p>
Application API keys are managed on the application level - see <em>deploy</em> view.
<!-- ToDo: this should be a separate view from deploy -->
An application can have multiple Application API keys.
</p><p>
Refer to the <a href="/reference/vespa-cloud-api#common-properties">api key</a> reference for details.
</p>



<h2 id="data-plane">Data plane</h2>
<p>
All application endpoints are secured with mutual TLS.
</p>


<h3 id="server-certificate">Server certificate</h3>
<p>
On first time deployment, a server certificate identifying the application is provisioned.
This certificate will be automatically set up on all application endpoints.
The certificate is signed by DigiCert or Globalsign.
</p>


<h3 id="client-certificate">Client certificate</h3>
<p>
To enable TLS client side authentication,
add trusted certificates (or issuer certificates) to <code>[application-package]/security/clients.pem</code>
With this, only clients with a valid certificate can access the application endpoints.
</p>
<!-- ToDo: this is confusing, consider remove from here and insted put it in the testing doc / link there / in appendix -->
<p>
In order to test application deployments,
another trusted client certificate is added by Vespa Cloud for deployment
to the test and staging zones <em>only</em>.
This does not affect production deployments.
</p>
<!-- end ToDo -->
<p>
To run system tests against a development endpoint,
specify the <code>dataPlaneCertificateFile</code> and <code>dataPlaneKeyFile</code> properties,
in the same manner as the <code>apiKeyFile</code> used for API access.
</p><p>
To add a new certificate/key pair:
<ol>
  <li>
    Generate a new pair - example:
<pre>
$ openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 \
  -subj "/CN=cloud.vespa.example" \
  -keyout data-plane-private-key.pem -out data-plane-public-cert.pem
</pre>
  </li><li>
    Add new public certificate to application package
    (it is OK with blank lines in <code>clients.pem</code> -
    <a href="https://github.com/vespa-engine/sample-apps/blob/master/vespa-cloud/vespa-documentation-search/src/main/application/security/clients.pem">example</a>):
<pre>
$ cat data-plane-public-cert.pem >> src/main/application/security/clients.pem
</pre>
  </li><li>
    Deploy application package
  </li><li>
    Use new cert/key pair in Vespa requests
  </li><li>
    Remove unused certs from <code>clients.pem</code> and deploy again
  </li>
</ol>
</p>


<h3 id="using-a-browser">Using a browser</h3>
<p>
In Vespa guides, <em>curl</em> is used in examples, like:
<pre>
$ curl --cert ./data-plane-public-cert.pem --key ./data-plane-private-key.pem $ENDPOINT
</pre>
To use a browser, install key/cert pair -
this procedure is tested on macOS Catalina / Chrome 80.0.3987.132,
assuming Certificate Common Name is "cloud.vespa.example" (as in the guides):
<ol>
  <li>
    Install key/cert pair:
<pre>
$ security import data-plane-private-key.pem -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain
$ security import data-plane-public-cert.pem -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain
</pre>
  </li><li>
    In Keychain Access: With <em>login</em> keychain -> My Certificates category -> cloud.vespa.example,
    right-click and "New Identity Preference", then add the endpoint url, like
    <em>https://me.my-app.mytenant1.aws-us-east-1c.dev.public.vespa.oath.cloud</em>
  </li><li>
    Open the same URL in Chrome, choose the example.com certificate
    and allow Chrome to read the private key.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>



<h2 id="application-isolation">Application isolation</h2>
<p>
All application nodes run as separate isolated Docker containers.
</p><p>
All internal communication between nodes in an application is secured in two layers:
<ul>
    <li>Network ACLs (iptables) allowing only local communication within the application</li>
    <li>Mutual TLS with authorization only allowing nodes from the same application</li>
</ul>
</p>



<h2 id="data-at-rest">Data at rest</h2>
<p>
All content written to Vespa is encrypted at rest.
</p>
