title: Zones
---

<p>
An application can be deployed to a <em>zone</em>,
which is a combination of an <a href="environments">environment</a>
and a <em>region</em>.
This lists all the zones which can be deployed to manually (dev and perf),
deployed to in production using <a href="deployment">deployment.xml</a> (prod),
or which is <a href="../automated-deployments">implicitly used to verify prod deployments</a>
(test and staging).
</p><p>
Available zones:
<table class="table table-striped">
<tr><th style="width:80px">Environment<th>Region</tr>
<tr><td><a href="environments#dev">dev</a>        <td>aws-us-east-1c</tr>
<tr><td><a href="environments#test">test</a>      <td>aws-us-east-1c</tr>
<tr><td><a href="environments#staging">staging</a><td>aws-us-east-1c</tr>
<tr><td><a href="environments#prod">prod</a>      <td>aws-us-east-1c</tr>
<tr><td><a href="environments#prod">prod</a>      <td>aws-ap-northeast-1a</tr>
<tbody>
</table>
If the application application requires zone-specific configuration,
use <a href="services#instance-environment-and-region-variants">
environment and region variants</a>.

<h2 id="routing-control">Routing control</h2>
<p>
Vespa Cloud has two mechanisms for manually controlling routing of requests to a zone:
<ul>
  <li>Endpoint configuration. This is changed by updating
  <a href="/reference/deployment">deployment.xml</a> and redeploying</li>
  <li>The application API</li>
</ul>
The example below describes the latter mechanism.
</p>


<h3>Inspect current routing status</h3>
<p>
With a tenant name <em>foo</em> and an application named <em>bar</em>,
the routing status for the <em>default</em> instance of the application in
zone <em>prod.aws-us-east-1c</em> can inspected at the following path:
<pre>
$ curl https://console.vespa.oath.cloud/api/routing/v1/status/tenant/foo/application/bar/instance/default/environment/prod/region/aws-us-east-1c | jq .
{
  "deployments": [
    {
      "routingMethod": "exclusive",
      "instance": "foo:bar:default",
      "environment": "prod",
      "region": "aws-us-east-1c",
      "status": "in",
      "agent": "system",
      "changedAt": 0
    }
  ]
}
</pre>
In this particular example, the status of zone <em>prod.aws-us-east-1c</em>
is <em>in</em> and the zone should be receiving requests.
</p>


<h3>Set zone out</h3>
<p>
In case of a production emergency,
a zone can be manully set out to prevent it from receiving requests:
<pre>
$ curl -XPOST https://console.vespa.oath.cloud/api/routing/v1/inactive/tenant/foo/application/bar/instance/default/environment/prod/region/aws-us-east-1c | jq .
{
  "message": "Set global routing status for foo.bar in prod.aws-us-east-1c to OUT"
}
</pre>
Inspecting the status will now show the status set to <em>out</em>.


<h3>Set zone in</h3>
<p>
To set the zone back in and have it continue receiving requests:
<pre>
$ curl -XDELETE https://console.vespa.oath.cloud/api/routing/v1/inactive/tenant/foo/application/bar/instance/default/environment/prod/region/aws-us-east-1c | jq .
{
  "message": "Set global routing status for foo.bar in prod.aws-us-east-1c to IN"
}
</pre>
</p>
