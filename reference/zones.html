title: Zones
---

<p>
An application can be deployed to a <em>zone</em>,
which is a combination of an <a href="environments">environment</a>
and a <em>region</em>.
This lists all the zones which can be deployed to manually (dev and perf),
deployed to in production using <a href="deployment">deployment.xml</a> (prod),
or which is <a href="../automated-deployments">implicitly used to verify prod deployments</a>
(test and staging).
</p><p>
Available zones:
<table class="table table-striped">
<tr><th style="width:80px">Environment<th>Region</tr>
<tr><td><a href="environments#dev">dev</a>        <td>aws-us-east-1c</tr>
<tr><td><a href="environments#test">test</a>      <td>aws-us-east-1c</tr>
<tr><td><a href="environments#staging">staging</a><td>aws-us-east-1c</tr>
<tr><td><a href="environments#prod">prod</a>      <td>aws-us-east-1c</tr>
<tbody>
</table>
If the application application requires zone-specific configuration,
use <a href="services-hosted#instance-environment-and-region-variants">
environment and region variants</a>.
