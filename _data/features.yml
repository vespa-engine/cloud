      Continuous deployment - automatically deploying changes as they are made to the application source -
      has emerged as a best practice across the industry because deploying small increments quickly lowers risk
      and increases efficiency. However, following this practice on stateful, distributed, always-available systems
      like Vespa is challenging, as deployments cannot cause service quality impact or risk of downtime.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Vespa Cloud provides all the necessary mechanisms to implement safe continuous deployment.
      Applications just create a job in their preferred CI tool which builds their application and submits
      it to the cloud and Vespa handles the rest. Applications remain in control of how and when changes roll
      out: The application package can specify allowed deployment time windows, the sequence and of deployment
      across zones, the delay between them and criteria for progressing with a rollout.
      </p>
      <p>
      Any deployment is validated in test zones before progressing to production zones: The <i>test</i>
      zone runs application defined functional tests, and the <i>staging</i> zone validates that
      the application can smoothly change from the current to the new application revision.
      The Vespa Cloud console provides a visualization of the status of the whole process and surfaces
      the information needed to diagnose any issues.
      </p>
      <p>
      Deployments in each zone happens without service disruption by applying changes without causing restarts.
      If restarts are necessary to apply changes, the Vespa Cloud will perform them automatically by taking
      down a single node (or group) of each cluster at a time. When deployments specify a change to the
      hardware running the application, the cloud will add the new hardware to it while leaving the old in place,
      and then remove the old later once data is safely migrated. Potentially unsafe changes are detected,
      and require a validation override as part of the deployment to ensure destructive changes are not
      made inadvertently.
      </p>
      <p>
      Continuous deployment is a transformative process that greatly increases productivity and reduces incidents,
      however implementing it for services on Vespa's complexity level is too hard for teams to do on their own.
      By deploying to the Vespa Cloud you get this capability out of the box, with safety features already
      proven to work for large business critical systems where any service disruption is intolerable.

  short: "<p>
      You want your application to use as few resources as possible to minimize cost,

      <p>
      The Vespa Cloud allows you to get both things at once
      by offering autoscaling on all clusters. This can often save 50% of cost
      of an application by keeping it scaled to its actual needs at all times.

  long: "<p>
      You want your application to use as few resources as possible to minimize cost,
      but at the same time you don't want to run out of resources when traffic is high
      or you feed more data. If you host yourself, you need to choose between
      always allocating enough hardware to handle the most load you may theoretically see,
      or risk running out of resources just when you need them the most.
      </p>
      <p>
      With the Vespa Cloud you don't have to choose but can let clusters maintain the optimal allocation
      required to handle the current load at any time. Stateless clusters can typically react to traffic
      changes on the scale of a few minutes, while content clusters require more time as data need to be
      redistributed on resource changes. Applications can typically save about half of their hardware cost by
      enabling this feature, while removing the risk of failing queries during peak or blocking writes due
      to feeding too much data. As always with the Vespa Cloud, applications remain in control and can set
      max and min limits on resources to fit their business objectives.

      And to make your service secure you <i>must</i> keep your Vespa and OS patch version up to date.
      Implementing a process for this is similar to automating deployment orchestration,

      fail to do this and instead resort to spending manual effort and redundant hardware doubling the cost
      to solve this.

      With Vespa Cloud, upgrading and OS patching is a solved problem you never worry about.
      We reuse the same mechanisms and tests used for continuous deployment to upgrade Vespa safely
      every day by default. Applications remain in control by having the option to specify when
      Vespa is allowed to upgrade. Similarly new OS versions are rolled out node by node in the background
      by an automated process. This keeps Vespa applications current and secure with no additional effort required
