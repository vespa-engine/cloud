      The Vespa cloud is running business critical applications on behalf of many organizations,
      handling about half a million user requests per second.
      We will keep your Vespa application running; you can focus on improving it.

      Vespa Cloud automatically updates daily to keep Vespa on the latest certified version,
      making sure your application has the latest bug fixes, performance improvements and new Vespa features -
      as well as the latest OS and security upgrades.
      No manual action or downtime needed to keep your instances up-to-date and safe.

      Why not let the team that's building Vespa and has years of experience operating it
      operate your applications as well?
      Setting up a Vespa instance for production is not hard, but
      operating securely and with high availability over time is challenging:
      Keeping the Vespa version and OS up to date, handling failing nodes, making
      continuous deployments safe and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Vespa cloud is already running business critical applications on behalf of many
      organizations, handling about half a million user requests per second.
      It performs all routine operations tasks automatically, which ensures
      they are performed in a timely fashion, following best practices, every time.
      This includes tasks such as
      </p>
      <ul class='list p-l-30 p-b-10'>
      <li>Detecting and replacing nodes with hardware issues.</li>
      <li>Rolling out <a href=\"en/automated-deployments.html\">application changes</a>.</li>
      <li>Upgrading Vespa and operating system.</li>
      <li><a href=\"en/autoscaling.html\">Optimizing hardware allocation</a> to fit the load.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      This leaves room for the Vespa Cloud engineers to analyze and work to mitigate problems before they
      have observable consequences. And for the rare time-critical issues that do happen,
      our on-call staff is ready to assist 24/7.
      </p>
      <p>
      Building out these capabilities is time-consuming and difficult, and manually operations
      is expensive and error-prone. Leaving this to the Vespa Cloud to get the best results
      at the lowest possible cost.
      </p>
      <p>
      You want to keep your applications running on the latest certified version of Vespa
      to get bug fixes, performance improvements and new features.
      And to make your service secure you <i>must</i> keep your Vespa and OS patch version up to date.
      Implementing a process for this is similar to automating deployment orchestration,
      with some additional complexity added on top.
      This is why most teams who host their own Vespa instances fail to do this
      and instead resort to spending manual effort and redundant hardware doubling the cost to solve this.
      </p>
      <p>
      With Vespa Cloud, upgrading and OS patching is a solved problem you never worry about.
      We reuse the same mechanisms and tests used for continuous deployment to upgrade Vespa safely every day by default.
      Applications remain in control by having the option to specify when Vespa is allowed to upgrade.
      Similarly new OS versions are rolled out node by node in the background by an automated process.
      This keeps Vespa applications current and secure with no additional effort required on the application side.

      Formal support by the very team that develops Vespa is included when you use the Vespa Cloud.
      We guarantee responses by next business day, and since all applications run in a controlled environment
      where we have access to detailed telemetry we are able to resolve most problems quickly - often before
      they become observable by you or your users.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
      But we don't stop there. Tuning performance on systems that mixes computation and data is a unique
      challenge with many subtleties, and expert tuning using live instrumentation can often reduce cost by 50%.
      When you deploy to the Vespa Cloud we also include enrollment in the annual tune-up program provided
      by the Vespa Performance team, which will ensure that your application stays efficient even as data and
      usage keeps evolving.
      </p>"
  long: "<p>
      Using the Vespa Cloud gives you access to the world's best Vespa support, period, and there's no
      other way to buy it. This is because this support is provided by the team that develops Vespa,
      and we prefer to provide support in an environment which we know is operated according to best practices.
      Just by using the Vespa Cloud, at no extra cost, you get access to next-business day support from the
      Vespa team.
      </p>
      <p>
      Tuning performance on systems that mixes computation and data is a unique challenge with
      many interesting subtleties. At the same time, gains from tuning may be substantial -
      it's often possible to cut cost in half.
      Since Vespa Cloud applications are extensively instrumented automatically, it is feasible
      for the performance specialists in the core Vespa team to analyze applications for performance
      optimizations with relatively little effort - applying their expert knowledge to realize these gains.
      </p>
      <p>
      Included when you deploy to the Vespa Cloud is participation in the Vespa tune-up program where
      our experts analyze your application for potential gains regularly at least yearly.
      As applications evolve and Vespa gains new performance optimizations, new opportunities
      for cost savings and performance improvements keep materializing, and the tune-up program ensures
      your application is always performing at its best.

      Continuous deployment - automatically deploying changes as they are made to the application source -
      has emerged as a best practice across the industry because deploying small increments quickly lowers risk
      and increases efficiency. However, following this practice on stateful, distributed, always-available systems
      like Vespa is challenging, as deployments cannot cause service quality impact or risk of downtime.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Vespa Cloud provides all the necessary mechanisms to implement safe continuous deployment.
      Applications just create a job in their preferred CI tool which builds their application and submits
      it to the cloud and Vespa handles the rest. Applications remain in control of how and when changes roll
      out: The application package can specify allowed deployment time windows, the sequence and of deployment
      across zones, the delay between them and criteria for progressing with a rollout.
      </p>
      <p>
      Any deployment is validated in test zones before progressing to production zones: The <i>test</i>
      zone runs application defined functional tests, and the <i>staging</i> zone validates that
      the application can smoothly change from the current to the new application revision.
      The Vespa Cloud console provides a visualization of the status of the whole process and surfaces
      the information needed to diagnose any issues.
      </p>
      <p>
      Deployments in each zone happens without service disruption by applying changes without causing restarts.
      If restarts are necessary to apply changes, the Vespa Cloud will perform them automatically by taking
      down a single node (or group) of each cluster at a time. When deployments specify a change to the
      hardware running the application, the cloud will add the new hardware to it while leaving the old in place,
      and then remove the old later once data is safely migrated. Potentially unsafe changes are detected,
      and require a validation override as part of the deployment to ensure destructive changes are not
      made inadvertently.
      </p>
      <p>
      Continuous deployment is a transformative process that greatly increases productivity and reduces incidents,
      however implementing it for services on Vespa's complexity level is too hard for teams to do on their own.
      By deploying to the Vespa Cloud you get this capability out of the box, with safety features already
      proven to work for large business critical systems where any service disruption is intolerable.

      Keeping online services secure is a never ending task. New attack vectors and vulnerabilities
      keep appearing and  requiring new defences. With the Vespa Cloud you get strong security by default
      at no additional cost. All communication between nodes is protected by mutual
      authentication and encryption, ensuring that only the intended nodes can communicate internally,
      and that only authorized clients can access an application. Data can additionally be secured by encryption.
      The Vespa security experts keeps Vespa and the underlying OS secure against the latest threats and
      the cloud keep you updated with those defences.

      The Vespa Cloud allows you to get both things at once by offering autoscaling on all clusters.
      This can often reduce the of cost of an application up to 50%
      by keeping it scaled to the actual needs at all times rather than always scaling for the expected peak traffic.
      </p>"
  long: "<p>
      You want your application to use as few resources as possible to minimize cost,
      but at the same time you don't want to run out of resources when traffic is high
      or you feed more data. If you host yourself, you need to choose between
      always allocating enough hardware to handle the most load you may theoretically see,
      or risk running out of resources just when you need them the most.
      </p>
      <p>
      With the Vespa Cloud you don't have to choose but can let clusters maintain the optimal allocation
      required to handle the current load at any time. Stateless clusters can typically react to traffic
      changes on the scale of a few minutes, while content clusters require more time as data need to be
      redistributed on resource changes. Applications can typically save about half of their hardware cost by
      enabling this feature, while removing the risk of failing queries during peak or blocking writes due
      to feeding too much data. As always with the Vespa Cloud, applications remain in control and can set
      max and min limits on resources to fit their business objectives.
