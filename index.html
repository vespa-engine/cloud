    Running big data applications is hard: it combines requirements for high availability, consistent low latency,
    and distributed state and computation. Outsource it to a team that has as their sole priority to do it well, and which
    has been at it for many years! It is as easy as deploying your application on the Vespa cloud service available in
    <a href="/reference/zones">AWS regions around the world</a>.
