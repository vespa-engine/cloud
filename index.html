        <h2>24/7 operations</h2>
        <p>
          Why not let the team that's building Vespa and has years of experience operating it
          operate your applications as well?
          Setting up a Vespa instance for production is not hard, but
          operating securely and with high availability over time is challenging:
          Keeping the Vespa version and OS up to date, handling failing nodes, making
          continuous deployments safe and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Vespa cloud is already running business critical applications on behalf of many
          organizations, handling about half a million user requests per second.
          It performs all routine operations tasks automatically, which ensures
          they are performed in a timely fashion, following best practices, every time.
          This includes tasks such as
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Detecting and replacing nodes with hardware issues.</li>
          <li>Deploying application changes.</li>
          <li>Upgrading Vespa and operating system.</li>
          <li>Optimizing hardware allocation to fit the load.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This leaves room for the Vespa Cloud engineers to analyze and work to mitigate problems before they
          have observable consequences. And for the rare time-critical issues that do happen,
          our on-call staff is ready to assist 24/7.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building out these capabilities is time-consuming and difficult, and manually operations
          is expensive and error-prone. Leaving this to the Vespa Cloud to get the best results
          at the lowest possible cost.

        <h2>Automatic, safe continuous deployment</h2>
        <p>
          Continuous deployment - automatically deploying changes as they are made to the application source -
          has emerged as a best practice across the industry because deploying small increments quickly lowers risk
          and increases efficiency. However, following this practice on stateful, distributed, always-available systems
          like Vespa is challenging, as deployments cannot cause service quality impact or risk of downtime.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Vespa Cloud provides all the necessary mechanisms to implement safe continuous deployment.
          Applications just create a job in their preferred CI tool which builds their application and submits
          it to the cloud and Vespa handles the rest. Applications remain in control of how and when changes roll
          out: The application package can specify allowed deployment time windows, the sequence and of deployment
          across zones, the delay between them and criteria for progressing with a rollout.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any deployment is validated in test zones before progressing to production zones:  The <i>test</i>
          zone runs application defined functional tests, and the <i>staging</i> zone validates that
          the application can smoothly change from the current to the new application revision.
          The Vespa Cloud console provides a visualization of the status of the whole process and surfaces
          the information needed to diagnose any issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deployments in each zone happens without service disruption by applying changes without causing restarts.
          If restarts are necessary to apply changes, the Vespa Cloud will perform them automatically by taking
          down a single node (or group) of each cluster at a time. When deployments specify a change to the
          hardware running the application, the cloud will add the new hardware to it while leaving the old in place,
          and then remove the old later once data is safely migrated. Potentially unsafe changes are detected,
          and require a validation override as part of the deployment to ensure destructive changes are not
          made inadvertently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Continuous deployment is a transformative process that greatly increases productivity and reduces incidents,
          however implementing it for services on Vespa's complexity level is too hard for teams to do on their own.
          By deploying to the Vespa Cloud you get this capability out of the box, with safety features already
          proven to work for large business critical systems where any service disruption is intolerable.

        <h2>Automatically keep your Vespa version and OS up to date</h2>
        <p>
          You want to keep your applications running on the latest certified version of Vespa
          to get bug fixes, performance improvements and new features.
          And to make your service secure you <i>must</i> keep your Vespa and OS patch version up to date.
          Implementing a process for this is similar to automating deployment orchestration,
          with some additional complexity added on top. This is why most teams who host their own Vespa instances
          fail to do this and instead resort to spending manual effort and redundant hardware doubling the cost
          to solve this.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Vespa Cloud, upgrading and OS patching is a solved problem you never worry about.
          We reuse the same mechanisms and tests used for continuous deployment to upgrade Vespa safely
          every day by default. Applications remain in control by having the option to specify when
          Vespa is allowed to upgrade. Similarly new OS versions are rolled out node by node in the background
          by an automated process. This keeps Vespa applications current and secure with no additional effort required
          on the application side.

          Keeping online services secure is a never ending task. New attack vectors and vulnerabilities

          at no additional cost. All communication between nodes is protected by mutual
          authentication and encryption, ensuring that only the intended nodes can communicate internally,
          and  that only authorized clients can access an application. Data can additional be secured by encryption.
          The Vespa security experts keeps Vespa and the underlying OS secure against the latest threats and
          the cloud keep  you updated with those defences.

        <p>
          Application security is an area which must be taken seriously, especially in systems storing and

        <h2>Automatically scale to meet your demand</h2>
        <p>
          You want your application to use as few resources as possible to minimize cost,
          but at the same time you don't want to run out of resources when traffic is high
          or you feed more data. If you host yourself, you need to choose between
          always allocating enough hardware to handle the most load you may theoretically see,
          or risk running out of resources just when you need them the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the Vespa Cloud you don't have to choose but can let clusters maintain the optimal allocation
          required to handle the current load at any time. Stateless clusters can typically react to traffic
          changes on the scale of a few minutes, while content clusters require more time as data need to be
          redistributed on resource changes. Applications can typically save about half of their hardware cost by
          enabling this feature, while removing the risk of failing queries during peak or blocking writes due
          to feeding too much data. As always with the Vespa Cloud, applications remain in control and can set
          max and min limits on resources to fit their business objectives.
