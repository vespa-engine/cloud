        <h2>24/7 operations</h2>
        <p>
          Why not let the team that's building Vespa and has years of experience operating it
          operate your applications as well?
          Setting up a Vespa instance for production is not hard, but
          operating securely and with high availability over time is challenging:
          Keeping the Vespa version and OS up to date, handling failing nodes, making
          continuous deployments safe and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Vespa cloud is already running business critical applications on behalf of many
          organizations, handling about half a million user requests per second.
          It performs all routine operations tasks automatically, which ensures
          they are performed in a timely fashion, following best practices, every time.
          This includes tasks such as
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Detecting and replacing nodes with hardware issues.</li>
          <li>Deploying application changes.</li>
          <li>Upgrading Vespa and operating system.</li>
          <li>Optimizing hardware allocation to fit the load.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This leaves room for the Vespa Cloud engineers to analyze and work to mitigate problems before they
          have observable consequences. And for the rare time-critical issues that do happen,
          our on-call staff is ready to assist 24/7.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building out these capabilities is time-consuming and difficult, and manually operations
          is expensive and error-prone. Leaving this to the Vespa Cloud to get the best results
          at the lowest possible cost.

        <h2>Automatic, safe continuous deployment</h2>
        <p>
          Continuous deployment - automatically deploying changes as they are made to the application source -
          has emerged as a best practice across the industry because deploying small increments quickly lowers risk
          and increases efficiency. However, following this practice on stateful, distributed, always-available systems
          like Vespa is challenging, as deployments cannot cause service quality impact or risk of downtime.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Vespa Cloud provides all the necessary mechanisms to implement safe continuous deployment.
          Applications just create a job in their preferred CI tool which builds their application and submits
          it to the cloud and Vespa handles the rest. Applications remain in control of how and when changes roll
          out: The application package can specify allowed deployment time windows, the sequence and of deployment
          across zones, the delay between them and criteria for progressing with a rollout.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any deployment is validated in test zones before progressing to production zones:  The <i>test</i>
          zone runs application defined functional tests, and the <i>staging</i> zone validates that
          the application can smoothly change from the current to the new application revision.
          The Vespa Cloud console provides a visualization of the status of the whole process and surfaces
          the information needed to diagnose any issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deployments in each zone happens without service disruption by applying changes without causing restarts.
          If restarts are necessary to apply changes, the Vespa Cloud will perform them automatically by taking
          down a single node (or group) of each cluster at a time. When deployments specify a change to the
          hardware running the application, the cloud will add the new hardware to it while leaving the old in place,
          and then remove the old later once data is safely migrated. Potentially unsafe changes are detected,
          and require a validation override as part of the deployment to ensure destructive changes are not
          made inadvertently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Continuous deployment is a transformative process that greatly increases productivity and reduces incidents,
          however implementing it for services on Vespa's complexity level is too hard for teams to do on their own.
          By deploying to the Vespa Cloud you get this capability out of the box, with safety features already
          proven to work for large business critical systems where any service disruption is intolerable.

        <h2>Cost Optimization: In-place Upgrades</h2>
        <p>
          Vespa is built to be always-on, also while upgrading.
          Vespa Cloud tracks Vespa.ai releases and
          upgrades <a href="https://vespa.ai/releases">multiple times a week</a>.
          Upgrading means taking nodes offline for new software install.
          Vespa Cloud cloud orchestrates the process, taking nodes offline safely one by one,
          and data is synced before upgrading the next node.
          This keeps all data available at all time, with no extra cluster setup.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          <img src="img/system-test.png" alt="In-place software and application updates"><br/>
        </p>
        <p>
          As all Vespa Cloud applications must be sized to tolerate single node failures,
          the upgrader stops upgrading during failures,
          and resumes once new nodes are in place, and data is synced.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, manually upgrading cluster takes time, and are often hence put off to later.
          Often a separate application is spun up, data is migrated, manual tests are run, etc.
          This has high costs in both HW/cloud resources and people time.

        <p>
          Launches are changes to capacity, configuration and/or code.
          To safeguard any change, Vespa Cloud has <a href="automated-deployments">Automated Deployments</a>.
          Automated Deployments are System, Staging and Production tests run at any deployment.
          This lets developers define quality metrics and test for these a-priori.
          The best teams build a strong test suite and are hence confident in all changes.
          These teams deploy changes to production more times a day,
          and are orders or magnitude more productive than without automated deployment.
