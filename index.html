          The best teams do not only train models, but build a system with signals to model training,

          This keeps the model current, and routine tasks are automated -
          all work can go into improving the model.

        <h2>Leading Edge</h2>
        <p>
          The best teams are global leaders in their business, or working to be.
          They drive Vespa to implement new features, so teams can innovate together.
          Vespa Cloud lets teams access features as they are built.
          Lead time from feature request to ready-to-use is at best days - but can be years,
          for game-changing features like <a
                href="https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/tensor-user-guide.html">tensors</a>
          and <a href="https://docs.vespa.ai/documentation/reference/query-language-reference.html">approximate
          nearest-neighbor</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Organizations use Vespa to get a competitive advantage,
          and <a href="https://vespa.ai/">Vespa.ai</a> enables that.
          They use Vespa Cloud to let teams use their expertise best,
          and work closely with Vespa Experts to use the right features the right ways.

        <h2>Cost Optimization: In-place Upgrades</h2>
        <p>
          Vespa is built to be always-on, also while upgrading.
          Vespa Cloud tracks Vespa.ai releases and
          upgrades <a href="https://vespa.ai/releases">multiple times a week</a>.
          Upgrading means taking nodes offline for new software install.
          Vespa Cloud cloud orchestrates the process, taking nodes offline safely one by one,
          and data is synced before upgrading the next node.
          This keeps all data available at all time, with no extra cluster setup.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
          <img src="img/system-test.png" alt="In-place software and application updates"><br/>
        </p>
        <p>
          As all Vespa Cloud applications must be sized to tolerate single node failures,
          the upgrader stops upgrading during failures,
          and resumes once new nodes are in place, and data is synced.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, manually upgrading cluster takes time, and are often hence put off to later.
          Often a separate application is spun up, data is migrated, manual tests are run, etc.
          This has high costs in both HW/cloud resources and people time.

        <p>
          Developers can deploy Sandbox applications to a Docker instance on their laptop, too -

        <h2>Performance Cloud</h2>

          Vespa applications range from applications with 100k documents and 100k query load,

          Update rates range from 0 to 10k/sec.
        </p>
        <p>
          The applications hence have different latency and throughput requirements,

        <h2>Safe Launches</h2>
        <p>
          The best launches are non-events.
          As any launch has a set of unknowns, it makes sense to pad node usage,
          then quickly scale back when in steady state - see Cluster Sizing.
          This eliminates the need for lengthy and costly pre-launch performance test cycles
          for both node instance type and number of nodes used.

        </p>
        <p>
          Launches are changes to capacity, configuration and/or code.
          To safeguard any change, Vespa Cloud has <a href="automated-deployments">Automated Deployments</a>.
          Automated Deployments are System, Staging and Production tests run at any deployment.
          This lets developers define quality metrics and test for these a-priori.
          The best teams build a strong test suite and are hence confident in all changes.
          These teams deploy changes to production more times a day,
          and are orders or magnitude more productive than without automated deployment.
